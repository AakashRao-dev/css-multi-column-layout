        This is the "Stay hungry, stay foolish" speech, addressed and delivered
        by Steve Jobs in 2005 at Stanford University:
      </h3>

      <p>
        I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the
        finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth
        be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.
        Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big
        deal. Just three stories.
      </p>

      <h2>The first story is about connecting the dots.</h2>

      <p>
        I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed
        around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So
        why did I drop out?
      </p>
      <p>
        It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed
        college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She
        felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so
        everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his
        wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that
        they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list,
        got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected
        baby boy; do you want him?" They said: "Of course." My biological mother
        later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that
        my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the
        final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my
        parents promised that I would someday go to college.
      </p>
      <p>
        And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college
        that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class
        parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six
        months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to
        do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it
        out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their
        entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work
        out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of
        the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop
        taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping
        in on the ones that looked interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the
        floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5&cent;
        deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town
        every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna
        temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my
        curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give
        you one example:
      </p>
      <p>
        Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy
        instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every
        label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had
        dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to
        take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif
        and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between
        different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great.
        It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science
        can't capture, and I found it fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.
        But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh
        computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.
        It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never
        dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never
        had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows
        just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have
        them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this
        calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful
        typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots
        looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear
        looking backwards ten years later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect
        them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow
        connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut,
        destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and
        it has made all the difference in my life.
