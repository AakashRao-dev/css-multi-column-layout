        "Twenty-five years ago, Apple released the computer that would save it
        from bankruptcy and pave the way for Apple to become the most important
        technology company ever."

      <h3>Twenty-five years of the iMac</h3>

      <p>
        On August 15th, 1998, the iMac hit store shelves. In the 25 years since
        then, the iMac has been a core product in Apple’s lineup and influenced
        many other products, both inside and outside the company. Today, we’re
        celebrating the iMac’s silver anniversary with a series of pieces
        exploring its design, influence, and future.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The original iMac entered a computing world that was in desperate need
        of a shake-up.
      </h2>

      <p>
        After the wild early days of the personal computer revolution, things
        had become stagnant by the mid-1990s. Apple had spent a decade
        frittering away the Mac’s advantages until most of them were gone, blown
        out of the water by the enormous splash of Windows 95. It was the era of
        beige desktop computers chained to big CRT displays and other
        peripherals.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1997, Steve Jobs returned to an Apple that was at death’s door, and
        in true Princess Bride style, he rapidly ran down a list of the
        company’s assets and liabilities. Apple didn’t have a wheelbarrow or a
        holocaust cloak, but it did have a young industrial designer who had
        been experimenting with colors and translucent plastic in Apple’s
        otherwise boring hardware designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Jobs’ brains, Jony Ive’s designs, and the new PowerPC G3 chip
        supplied by Motorola, the company began to form a plan. Essentially,
        Jobs went back to his playbook for the original “computer for the rest
        of us,” the Mac, to sell simplicity. The Mac’s mouse-driven graphical
        interface may have changed the course of the PC world, but its
        all-in-one design just hadn’t clicked. Jobs decided it was time to try
        again.
      </p>

      <h2>The anti-computer</h2>
      <p>
        The iMac contradicted every rule of the PC industry of the mid-’90s.
        Instead of being modular, it was a self-contained unit (with a built-in
        handle!). Beige was out, and translucent blue-green plastic was in. The
        iMac looked like nothing else in the computer industry. But the iMac
        wasn’t just a rule-breaker when it came to looks. Jobs made a series of
        decisions that were surprising at the time, though he’d keep repeating
        them throughout his tenure at Apple. The iMac gave no consideration to
        compatibility or continuity and embraced promising new technology when
        the staid PC industry refused.

        technology when the staid PC industry refused.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the 1980s, Macs connected to accessories via a few standard ports:
        SCSI (for fast connections to devices like drives and scanners), serial
        (for printers, modems, and local networking), and Apple Desktop Bus (for
        keyboards and mice). Mac users had built up ecosystems around all those
        ports, separate from the incompatible serial and parallel ports in the
        PC world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jobs threw all that stuff in the trash and started again. Instead of old
        ports, the iMac would use a new standard that hadn’t really caught fire
        in the PC world: Universal Serial Bus, or USB.

      <p>
        The iMac gets remembered for a lot of things, and rightly so, but it
        doesn’t get enough credit for essentially kick-starting the USB
        revolution. (I can type on a 25-year-old iMac USB keyboard attached to a
        2023 Mac Mini with no adapters! What stunning longevity.)
