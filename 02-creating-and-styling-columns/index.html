    <h2>Inspire the testing community with your content</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>LambdaTestâ€™s guest blogger program</strong> is for anyone who is
      passionate about the developer and testing space. We are a people-driven
      org, and community is our foundation. As 2 Million+ developers and testers
      use LambdaTest to make their everyday jobs more fulfilling and simpler, we
      realized that we also have to do our bit in telling the stories of the
      community, for the community at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      And who better to tell the stories from the trenches than experts like
      you. Our aim through this initiative is to create a robust testing
      community and bring together like-minded people to share their thoughts
      and ideas.

    <h2>How to submit your blog idea or guest post?</h2>
    <p>
      Submit your blog idea along with a brief introduction of yourself. Our
      team will review your blog idea and let you know if your submission is
      accepted. We will get back to you within two weeks of your submission
      day.Once your proposal is approved, you can get to the fun part!
    </p>
    <p>
      Start writing your blog. Please make sure you check our guidelines before
      you start writing. Format your draft appropriately. We don't enforce a
      strict word count on the blog, but most articles should fall in the 1500 -
      1800 word range. Instead of hitting a specific word count, focus on clear,
      in-depth explanations that readers of all levels can understand and learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your draft is ready, you can submit it by including your name and a
      short biography about yourself. If the draft meets our editorial
      standards, we will get in touch with you and let you know when it will be
      published. LambdaTest reserves the right not to respond to submissions
      that do not meet the guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, LambdaTest reserves the right to proofread, edit and adapt
      content as we see fit. And while we hope your posts have a long life on
      the LambdaTest blog, we reserve the right to remove them at any point in
      time.
